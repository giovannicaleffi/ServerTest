# ServerTest

If I run MultiEchoServer class, it works with no problems and I can easily connect to the server (using Ubuntu, I am a Windows user) with the command `/usr/bin/nc 127.0.0.1 1234`.

After that, if I write a text and I send it to the server, I receive back the same message as it should be. But when I write `quit`, the connection does not close itself immediately, but only after two messages (in the screenshot I only pressed twice the Enter button).
